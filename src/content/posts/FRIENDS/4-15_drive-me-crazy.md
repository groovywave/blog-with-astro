Monica: Joey, let me ask you a question. It's been **driving me crazy**. What does this light switch do?<br>
<br>
Joey: Ohh, Nothing.<br>
<br>
Monica: Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?<br>
<br>
Joey: I know what it did! Nothing.<br>
<br>
Monica: They **wouldn't have put** it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?<br>
<br>
