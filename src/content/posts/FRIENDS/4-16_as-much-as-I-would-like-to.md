Rachel: Listen, we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.<br>
<br>
Chandler: What are you talking about?<br>
<br>
Joey: Yeah, what's going on?<br>
<br>
Rachel: We have to have surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I've created the perfect opportunity to seduce him!<br>
<br>
Ross: Well, **as much as I'd like to** meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to **come by** first to say good-bye,and then I've got whole special evening planned. So, sorry, no party.<br>
<br>
Joey: Awww!
