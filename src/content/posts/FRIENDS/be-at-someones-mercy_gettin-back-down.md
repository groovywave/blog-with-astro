C: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?<br>
<br>
R: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She **was totally at my mercy**.<br>
<br>
C: Were you to late because you were burying this woman?<br>
<br>
R: No, I'm **getting back down** 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like, two and a half hours away.
