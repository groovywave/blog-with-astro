Monica: hey, **cheer up**! You're gonna see her again, right? <br><br>
Ross: **That's the thing**, I don't know! I mean, whenever I **brought it up with her** she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..." <br><br>
Monica: No, don't -don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.<br><br>
Ross: why do you care so much?<br><br>
Monica: Because! You could **get to** live out my fantasy!<br><br>
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?<br><br>
Monica: No! You know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, **fall madly in love**, and spend **the rest of your lives** together.<br><br>
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one who **hung out with** that Ukrainian kid?
