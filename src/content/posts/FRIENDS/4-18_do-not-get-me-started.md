Phoebe: Hey! What are you doing here?<br><br>
Alice: Umm, actually, I **came down** to **ask you a big favor**.<br><br>
Phoebe: Oh, well, **don't tell me** you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.<br><br>
Alice: No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I want to name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank Jr. Jr.<br><br>
Chandler: Wouldn't that be Frank the Ⅲ<br><br>
Alice: **Don't get me started**...Anyway, ummm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honored if you named the other boy baby.<br><br>
Phoebe: Wow! That's so nice! Oh! Oh! Cougar.<br><br>
Alice: You think about it.<br><br>
don't get me started　: 私だって言いたいことがあるんだからやめて
