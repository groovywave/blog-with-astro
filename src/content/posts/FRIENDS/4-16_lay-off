I should **lay off** sweets for a while.<br>
<br>
She was **laid off** last week.<br>
<br>
**Lay off** him! He didn't do anything wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joey: Feel better now?<br><br>
Phoebe: Yeah, but **at what cost**? six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, you know, millions of cows.<br><br>
Joey: Hey, **what if** I said, I could **even things out** for you, **meat-wise**.<br><br>
Phoebe: what?<br><br>
Joey: Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?<br><br>
Phoebe: Yeah.<br><br>
Joey: But **suppose**, until the baby's born I **laid off** it. No **extra** animals woukld die, you'd just be eating my animals.<br><br>
Phoebe: Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.<br><br>
Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Thre's no meat in beer, right?
