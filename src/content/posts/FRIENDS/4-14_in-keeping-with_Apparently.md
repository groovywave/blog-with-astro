Rachel: There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...<br>
<br>
Emily: Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.<br>
<br>
Rachel: Oh well, no...<br>
<br>
Emily: Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude. It's perfectly **in keeping with** a trip that I've already been **run down by** one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F.Kennedy Airport. **Apparently** to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.<br>
