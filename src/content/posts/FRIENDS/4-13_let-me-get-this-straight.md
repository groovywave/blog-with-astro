Chandler: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!<br>
<br>
Kathy: Okay, so **let me just get this straight**. You're **accusing** me of **cheating on you**, and **insulting** my performance?<br>
<br>
Chandler: Y'know, I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.<br>
