Chandler: Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!<br>
<br>
Phoebe: that's a good idea for a business!<br>
<br>
Chandler: I'm totally **screwd**. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to **undermine me**. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"<br>
