Chandler: Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!<br>
<br>
Phoebe: that's a good idea for a business!<br>
<br>
Chandler: I'm totally **screwd**. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"<br>
