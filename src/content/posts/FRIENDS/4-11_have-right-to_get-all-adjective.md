P: Oh, I get a puppy!!<br>
<br>
S: Well, yeah!! I mean yeah, but only for three days.<br>
<br>
P: Why?<br>
<br>
S: I realize I don't **have any right to** start **get all parenty** on you and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn't paying attention and is busy mimicking the puppy.) uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important. <br>
<br>
P: Okay.<br>
<br>
S: I mean I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy again, and not listening) I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.<br>
