M: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.<br>
<br>
P: Oh.<br>
<br>
M: I thought I **was making headway**, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that wrote this (puts on the chef hat) on my chef's hat. (The hat says 'Quit bitch')<br>
<br><br>
P: Hey, maybe they mean to write, 'Quiet bitch'.<br>
<br>
M: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarden and they had to bringing someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)<br>

P: Hey, maybe they mean to write, 'Quiet bitch'.<br>
