Mr.Waltham: I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London - well Shropshire really but y'know - well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to **keep her company** this evening?<br>
<br>
Rachel: Sure. You got it. Great!<br>
<br>
Mr.Waltham: Oh, good. <br>
