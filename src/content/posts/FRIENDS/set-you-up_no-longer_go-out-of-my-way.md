R: Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.<br>
<br>
C: Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to **set you up**?<br>
<br>
R: Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?<br>
<br>
C: Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I **no longer** feel the need to **go out of my way** to stop others from being happy. <br>
<br>
R: Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.<br>
<br>
C: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?<br>
