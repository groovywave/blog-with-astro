Monica: Of course there's another guy! This is **even more perfect**! Now you have to  prove your love!<br><br>
Ross: I'm not proving anything Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport **in the first place**, I never wouldn't put my fist through the wall.<br><br>
