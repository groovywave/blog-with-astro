Monica: Why do you care so much anyway?<br>
<br>
Rachel: I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!<br>
<br>
Monica: Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.<br>
<br>
Rachel: Oh, y'know, **would you just for once**, not remember every little thing!<br>
